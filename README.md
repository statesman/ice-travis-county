(not even sorry)

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook with scripts to process and analyze ICE detainer data in Travis County, Texas, from Jan. 1, 2006, to Oct. 4, 2016.

### Requirements
* python
* virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper

### Setup
Clone or DL this repo, then:
```shell
$ cd ice-travis-county
$ mkvirtualenv ice-data
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ jupyter notebook ice-data-parser.ipynb
```

### Assumptions and data issues

#### Pre-ICE data excluded
Data before 2006 was less reliable, so records before Jan. 1, 2006 -- including some records that pre-date the formation of ICE -- are excluded.

#### Grouping by country
For the purposes of tallying detainees' self-reported countries of origin, we classified the Federated States of Micronesia (a U.S. "associated state" with its own U.N. representative) as its own country. Others, we grouped with their "parent" countries:
* British Indian Ocean Territory (United Kingdom)
* French Southern and Antartic [_sic_] Lands (France)
* Guadeloupe (France)
* Guam (United States)
* Hong Kong (China)
* Howland Island (United States)
* Juan de Nova Island (France)
* Northern Mariana Islands (United States)
* Puerto Rico (United States)
* Tokelau (New Zealand)
* Virgin Islands (United States)
